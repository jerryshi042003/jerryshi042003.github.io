Within the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) of Southeast Asia, efforts towards malaria elimination have reduced the overall malaria burden, and a better understanding of where <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes may contribute to these efforts. One means of accomplishing this is through the use of remote sensing, coupled with bioclimatic envelopes, to determine habitat for <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes within the GMS. This project demonstrates how  Google Earth Engine can be utilized in this capacity. Preliminary examination of how <em>Anopheles</em> habitat has changed over time suggests that all species studied in the GMS have seen an expansion in habitat, although more work is needed to ensure that the habitat identified is accurate and not the result of an artifact introduced during the processing workflow.
