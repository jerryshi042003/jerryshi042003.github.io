Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are a critical component of public health responses to <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. However, the continued use of RDTs is being threatened by the emergence of parasite mutations that lack the relevant protein used in diagnostic testing. This R Shiny app was developed under contract to the World Health Organization with other researchers to allow policy makers to explore the factors that influence the spread of the mutations.

The complete source code and some documentation can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/jerryshi042003/WHO-Malaria-pfhrp23 and the app is currently hosted by the World Health Organization at https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/DeletionRiskExplorer.
